Below is one example of how you might break up your large home page file into smaller, focused files without affecting the overall design, layout, or functionality. The key idea is to extract the distinct sections—the scaffold with the app bar and tabs, the individual content areas (such as the “Your Movies” and “mNp(s)” tabs), the recording dialog, and some helper methods—into their own files. One possible directory model is as follows:

```plaintext
lib/
└── screens/
    └── home/
        ├── home_page.dart              // Main screen file that sets up the scaffold, TabController, and navigation.
        ├── dialogs/
        │   └── recording_dialog.dart   // Contains the dialog that manages voice recording and movie idea display.
        ├── tabs/
        │   ├── movies_tab.dart         // Contains UI and logic for displaying “Your Movies.”
        │   └── forks_tab.dart          // Contains UI and logic for displaying “mNp(s)” movies.
        ├── widgets/
        │   └── create_movie_button.dart// Contains the create movie button (with tutorial overlay and gesture detection).
        └── utils/
            ├── speech_helper.dart      // Contains speech initialization, handling, and processing functions.
            └── date_formatter.dart     // Contains utility functions (like formatting timestamps).
```

### How This Helps

- **home_page.dart**  
  Remains the entry point for the Home screen. It wires up the layout, tab bar, and overall navigation while delegating specific UI sections to subcomponents.

- **dialogs/recording_dialog.dart**  
  Extracts the dialog used when a user starts recording. All UI and interactions related to voice recording and processing the movie idea go here.

- **tabs/movies_tab.dart & tabs/forks_tab.dart**  
  Encapsulate the logic and UI for the “Your Movies” and “mNp(s)” tabs, respectively. This helps keep the tab view code clean and focused.

- **widgets/create_movie_button.dart**  
  Contains the widget used in the app bar (wrapped in a TutorialOverlay), along with gesture handling (double-tap to start/stop recording). This component can be reused as needed.

- **utils/speech_helper.dart**  
  Collects all functions related to the speech functionality (_initializeSpeech(), _startListening(), _stopListening(), _processMovieIdea() etc.) so that the main file remains focused on UI and navigation.

- **utils/date_formatter.dart**  
  Centralizes the timestamp formatting logic to keep UI code clean and to allow for consistency across the app.

Using this structure allows you to work on individual pieces (such as the recording functionality or the movie lists) in isolation while preserving the overall behavior. This refactoring improves maintainability and readability without affecting the design or layout your users experience.
